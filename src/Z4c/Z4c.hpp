Breif: General header for Z4c formulation
       In this impelementation, we follow the Z4c formulation that is reported in
       Bernuzzi & Hilditch (2010) and Hilditch et al. (2013).
       The Z4c system is comprised of dynamical variable:
       chi: Conformal factor (scalar)
       gt : Induced 3-metric (rank-2)
       Kh : Trace of extrinsic curvature (scalar)
       At : Traceless of extrinsic curvature (rank-2)
       Theta : Temporal projection of Z4 vector (scalar)
       Gt : Conformaly-related function (3-vector)

       In addtion, we follow typical gauge choice:
       Bona-Masso for lapse, alpha (scalar) \TODO :maybe 1+log?
       Gamma-driver for shift, beta (3-vector) and B (3-vector)
