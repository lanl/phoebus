# Attaining the Source Code

`phoebus` uses submodules extensively. To make sure you get them all, clone it as
```bash
git clone --recursive git@github.com:lanl/phoebus.git
```
or as
```bash
git clone git@github.com:lanl/phoebus.git
cd phoebus
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

# Building

## Prerequisites

Here are a few tips and tricks for using and building phoebus. The first
step is creating a build directory, as in-source builds are
forbidden. Assuming you just cloned phoebus,
```bash
cd phoebus
mkdir bin
cd bin
```

You also need to make sure you have appropriate dependencies in your
path. On Darwin, loading the following modules (in this order) will
work:
```bash
module load gcc/7.4.0 cuda/10.2 openmpi/4.0.1-gcc_7.4.0 cmake/3.17.3
```
(The default build for `parthenon` requires Python3 loaded. This is
not the case for `phoebus`.)

If you want output, make sure `hdf5` is available as well. On
`Darwin`, this likely means a spack environment. On `snow`, just load
the appropriate module. If you are compiling with mpi, use
`hdf5-parallel`, otherwise `hdf5-serial`.

If `cmake` can't find your hdf5 installation, You may have luck
setting `-DHDF5_ROOT=/path/to/hdf5` at configure time.

## Example builds

Below are some example build commands

### MPI-parallel only

The following will build `phoebus` with the `triple` problem with MPI parallelism but no shared memory parallelism
```bash
cmake ..
make -j
```

### OpenMP-parallel

The following will build `phoebus` with OpenMP parallelism only
```bash
cmake -DPHOEBUS_ENABLE_MPI=Off -DPHOEBUS_ENABLE_OPENMP=ON ..
make -j
```

### Cuda

The following will build `phoebus` with no MPI or OpenMP parallelism.
```bash
cmake -DPHOEBUS_ENABLE_CUDA=On -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=${HOME}/phoebus/external/singularity-eos/utils/kokkos/bin/nvcc_wrapper -DKokkos_ARCH_HSW=ON -DKokkos_ARCH_VOLTA70=ON -DPHOEBUS_ENABLE_MPI=OFF ..
```
A few notes for this one:
- Note here the `-DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER` flag. This is necessary. You *must* set the compiler to `nvcc_wrapper` provided by Kokkos.
- Note the `-DKokkos_ARCH_*` flags. Those set the host and device microarchitectures and are required. The choice here is on an `x86_64` machine with a `volta` GPU.

## Build Options

The build options explicitly provided by `phoebus` are:

| Option             | Default | Comment                                            |
| ------------------ | ------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| PHOEBUS_ENABLE_CUDA   | OFF     | Cuda                                               |
| PHOEBUS_ENABLE_HDF5   | ON      | HDF5. Required for output and restarts.            |
| PHOEBUS_ENABLE_MPI    | ON      | MPI. Required for distributed memory parallelism.  |
| PHOEBUS_ENABLE_OPENMP | OFF     | OpenMP. Required for shared memory parallelism.    |
| MACHINE_CFG        | None    | Machine-specific config file, optional.            |

Some relevant settings from Parthenon and Kokkos you may need to play with are:

| Option                   | Default | Comment                                                   |
| ------------------------ | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER       | None    | Must be set to `nvcc_wrapper` with cuda backend           |
| Kokkos_ARCH_XXXX         | OFF     | You must set the GPU architecture when compiling for Cuda |

You can see all the Parthenon build options [here](https://github.com/lanl/parthenon/blob/develop/docs/building.md) and all the Kokkos build options [here](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos/wiki/Compiling)

## Cmake machine configs

If you are proficient with `cmake` You can optionally write a `cmake`
file that sets the configure parameters that you like on a given
machine. Both `phoebus` and `parthenon` can make use of it. You can point to the file with 
```
-DMACHINE_CFG=path/to/machine/file
```
at config time or by setting the environment variable `MACHINE_CFG` to point at it, e.g.,
```bash
export MACHINE_CFG=path/to/machine/file
```

An example machine file might look like
```
# Machine file for x86_64-volta on Darwin
message(STATUS "Loading machine configuration for Darwin x86-volta node")
message(STATUS "Assumes: module load module load gcc/7.4.0 cuda/10.2 openmpi/4.0.3-gcc_7.4.0 anaconda/Anaconda3.2019.10 cmake && spack load hdf5")
message(STATUS "Also assumes you have a valid spack installation loaded.")

set(PHOEBUS_ENABLE_CUDA ON CACHE BOOL "Cuda backend")
set(PHOEBUS_ENABLE_MPI OFF CACHE BOOL "No MPI")
set(Kokkos_ARCH_HSW ON CACHE BOOL "Haswell target")
set(Kokkos_ARCH_VOLTA70 ON CACHE BOOL "volta target")
set(CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER /home/jonahm/phoebus/external/parthenon/external/Kokkos/bin/nvcc_wrapper CACHE STRING "nvcc wrapper")
```

you could then configure and compile as

```bash
cmake -DMACHINE_CFG=path/to/machine/file ..
make -j
```

# Running

Run phoebus from the `build` directory as
```bash
./src/phoebus -i path/to/input/file.phin
```
The input files are in `phoebus/inputs/*`. There's typically one input file per problem setup file.

## Submodules

- `parthenon` our messh infrastructure
- `singularity-eos` provides performance-portable equations of state and PTE solvers
- `Kokkos` provides performance portable shared-memory parallelism. It allows our loops to be
  CUDA, OpenMP, or something else. By default we use the `Kokkos` shipped with `parthenon`.

## External (Required)

- `cmake` for building

## Optional

- `hdf5` for output
- `MPI` for distributed memory parallelism
- `python3` for visualization
