<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Phoebus</span></code> uses a <em>hybrid flat-and-hierarchical</em> organizational
structure.</div>
<div class="line">The flat structure fosters power sharing among senior and junior
members and avoids the many pitfalls of power-over dynamics. For
example, in power-over structures, someone with explicit power can
inadvertently, or on rare occasions intentionally, silence critical
voices.</div>
<div class="line">This dynamic can quickly lead to an organization overlooking inherent
problems that could lead to ineffectiveness or even catastrophic
failure of the team.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">In contrast, our aim is to illuminate potential problems early and
quickly find solutions.</div>
<div class="line">This strategy also efficiently taps into the diverse wealth of
knowledge of the team.</div>
<div class="line">At the same time, the PI and Co-PI have financial and reporting
responsibilities to their respective universities and funding
agencies.</div>
<div class="line">The general procedure for the hybrid structure is as follows.</div>
<div class="line">The flat structure will make major decisions in direction and
resources, and the PI and Co-PI will assume the responsibility for
executing those decisions.</div>
<div class="line">The following gives details on this hybrid structure.</div>
</div>
<section id="team">
<h2>Team<a class="headerlink" href="#team" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>The founding team consists of the following: original core developers
and Maintainers at Los Alamos National Lab, Jeremiah Murphy at Florida
State University, and Carl Fields at University of Arizona.</p>
<p>Since, an objective of Phoebus is to grow the developer and user base,
the Phoebus Project will have an explicit mechanism for adding new
members. There are three categories for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Phoebus</span></code> members:
maintainers, contributors, and users.</p>
<p><strong>User</strong>: As open-source software, anyone may download, compile, and
execute <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Phoebus</span></code>. New users will encouraged to join communication
channels for connection with the larger <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Phoebus</span></code> community.</p>
<p><strong>Contributor</strong>: Users who wish to contribute to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Phoebus</span></code> may do so
following our Development Model for new users. These changes will be
integrated into the main branch of the code upon approval. Consistent
contributions also provides the opportunity for Contributors to be
eligible to join as a <em>Maintainer</em>, the final approval of which will
require a vote.</p>
<p><strong>Maintainer</strong>: These are the core team who have “merge” permissions on
the repo and are working to keep the code sustainable long term.</p>
<p>To maintain their relevant active status, all members must
make a food faith effort to maintain a supportive, productive environment.</p>
</section>
<section id="memorandum-of-understanding">
<span id="mou"></span><h2>Memorandum of Understanding<a class="headerlink" href="#memorandum-of-understanding" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>In addition to our Community Code of Conduct, we ask that maintainers
especially keep the following suggestions in mind to help
facilitate an efficient and welcoming collaboration:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Maintainers should uphold and exemplify the <em>Development Model</em>
outlined as part of the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">phoebus</span></code> Community described
<a class="reference internal" href="contributing.html"><span class="doc">here</span></a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Within reason, maintainers will make a good-faith effort to attend team
meetings. In an effort to accommodate the dynamic schedules and
availability of many of the core team of <em>Maintainers</em>,
coordination efforts will be made to ensure that <em>at least</em>
1 <em>Maintainer</em> is present for all meetings.</p></li>
<li><p>Maintainers will make a good-faith effort to monitor the fraction of
the meeting time that they speak. The meeting time is limited, and
several people may have something interesting to say, report on their
updates, or contribute constructive arguments. One should be
self-aware and notice if one is dominating conversations, and attempt
to make a conscious effort to include other voices and perspectives
in the discussion.</p></li>
<li><p>Maintainers consider it their responsibility to voice their questions
and/or concerns as early as possible. This will ensure that the
organization addresses concerns rapidly and effectively.</p></li>
<li><p>Maintainers consider it their responsibility to listen and understand
questions or concerns raised by other partners or through concerns
communicated through email to individual <em>Maintainers</em>.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="approval-by-vote">
<h2>Approval by Vote:<a class="headerlink" href="#approval-by-vote" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Many of the decisions in the organization will be enacted after an
approval by majority vote of active Maintainers. The process of listening
and adjusting strategies to meet everyone’s needs is vital for
power-sharing organizations.</div>
<div class="line">Importantly, spending a little time up front to listen and resolve
concerns reduces the pain and time spent later in intense conflict
resolution.</div>
</div>
</section>
<section id="communication-and-connection">
<h2>Communication and Connection:<a class="headerlink" href="#communication-and-connection" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">To facilitate open and effective communication, the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Phoebus</span></code> will
offer multiple levels of communication.
Developers will communicate via email, GitHub, and a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Phoebus</span></code> Slack
channel.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">To respond to user inquiries, the Phoebus Project will host a mailing
list via Google or similar.</div>
<div class="line">To maintain a standing record of user inquiries and responses, we will
post the inquiries and responses on a public-facing site.</div>
<div class="line">All Maintainers will have the option to respond to the inquires; to
ensure that someone is responsive to the user inquiries, the team will
triage tickets/questions in developer meetings.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Subject to availability, monthly Maintainer meetings will also
be an important part of ensuring productivity and timeliness.</div>
<div class="line">Each meeting will last up to 60 minutes. We will assess and discuss
the goals from the previous meeting.</div>
<div class="line">In particular, we will take note which goals were completed and which
were not. If there are uncompleted goals, we will assess why they were
not completed. Next, we will discuss the goals for the upcoming month,
quarter, and year.</div>
<div class="line">We will decide which goals to prioritize.</div>
<div class="line">All of this will be recorded on an online document which will be
available to all Maintainers.</div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Each meeting of the core Maintainers will be managed by a meeting
manager.</div>
<div class="line">The primary job of the meeting manager is to: 1) gather a list of
agenda items for the next meeting, 2) ensure that the meeting runs on
schedule, and 3) ensure equitable participation by all participants.</div>
<div class="line">Again, in keeping with power-sharing, the meeting manager position
will rotate among the core Maintainers, even junior members.</div>
</div>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>We maintain some flexibility in the cadence and structure of meetings, in
particular, in periods of low activity, meetings may be skipped or
held in a less formal manner. We recognize that the availability
of maintainers is contingent upon many factors.</p>
