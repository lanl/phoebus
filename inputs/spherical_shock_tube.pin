# Spherical shock tube presented in Guzman, Lora-Clavijo, and Morales, 2012.
# arXiv:1212.1421

# This is just the shock tube with several different potential
# settings, a weak blast and a strong one:
# 1. Pl = 1, Pr = 0.1, rhol = 1, rhor = 0.125, vl = vr = 0
# 2. pl = 13.33, pr = 0.1, rhol = 10., rhor = 1., vl = vr = 0

# Both problems assume ideal gas with adiabatic index gamma = 1.4.
# Solutions lead to what looks like a shock tube, but with a curved
# density structure
