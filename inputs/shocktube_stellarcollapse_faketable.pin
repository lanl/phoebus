# Sod shock tube for fake stellar collapse table generated with ideal gas eos
# to generate, run
# python external/singularity-eos/utils/scripts/make_tabulated_gamma.py -o ideal_gas.h5
# to generate ideal gas table.
# optionally run the stellarcollapse2spiner utility in singularity-eos to convert to a
# stellar collapse file. This will make reading the table much faster.
