Contributing
=============================

For the purpose of our development model, we label *Contributors* or
*Maintainers* of ``Phoebus``. Below we describe these labels and the
process for contributing to ``Phoebus``.

Becoming a Contributor
----------------------

We welcome contributions from scientists from a large variety of
relativistic astrophysics. New users are welcome to contributions to
``Phoebus`` via the *Contributors* process. Contributors with 6 merged
pull requests into the ``main`` branch (over a minimum of 6 months) will
be eligible to join as a *Maintainer* of ``Phoebus`` with additional
repository access and roles. However, final approval of *Maintainer*
status will require a unanimous approval by vote by existing
*Maintainers*, a necessary step to ensure the safety and integrity of
the code base for all users of ``Phoebus``.

The *Maintainers* of ``Phoebus`` consist of the original developers of
the code and those that have a demonstrated history in the development
of ``Phoebus`` prior to the implementation of the *Development Model*
described here. Maintainers hold admin access, serve consistently as
reviewers for pull requests, and are in charge of the maintaining,
deployment, and improvement of efforts towards: regression testing,
documentation, science test cases (gold standards), and continuous
integration.

To maintain their active status as Maintainer, all members will agree to
adhere to our Community Code of Conduct and adhere to a Memorandum of
Understanding described `here <GOVERNANCE.md>`__.

Contributing to ``Phoebus``
-----------------------------

**Contributors**: (process for most users of ``Phoebus``)

1. Create a new fork of ``main`` where your changes can be made.
2. After completing, create a pull request, describe the final approach
   and ensure the branch has no conflicts with current Regression Tests
   and Formatting Checks.
3. Assign external reviewers (a minimum of 1, one of which should be a
   Maintainer, and which cannot be the contributor). Provide concise
   description of changes.
4. Once comments/feedback is addressed, the PR will be merged into the
   main branch and changes will be added to list of changes in the next
   release.
5. At present, Releases (with a git version tag) for the ``main`` branch
   of ``Phoebus`` will occur at a 6 to 12 month cadence or following
   implementation of a major enhancement or capability to the code base.

*Maintainers* of ``Phoebus`` will follow the same process for
contributions as above except for the following differences: they may
create branches directly within ``Phoebus``, they will hold repository
admin privileges, and actively participate in the technical review of
contributions to ``Phoebus``.
