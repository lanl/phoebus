Code of Conduct
=====================================

We as users, members, contributors, and leaders agree to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone.
We will interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

We agree to uphold the `LANL Code of Conduct <lanlcode>`_ in all spaces relevant. 
Of note:

::

   -  Foster a mutually respectful working environment that is free from
      discrimination, intimidation, and harassment (including sexual
      harassment).
   -  Do not discriminate against others on the basis of any
      characteristic protected by law or LANL policy.
   -  Do not engage in behaviors that create an offensive, hostile, or
      intimidating work environment, including shouting, abusive
      language, threats of violence, the use of obscenities or other
      non-verbal expressions of aggression, horseplay such as kicking
      co-workersâ€™ chairs or using personal insults, or the use of
      offensive nicknames or other derogatory remarks.
   -  Avoid behavior that a reasonable person would find to be demeaning
      or humiliating.
