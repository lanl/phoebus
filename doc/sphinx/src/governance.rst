Organizational Structure
==========================

| ``Phoebus`` uses a *hybrid flat-and-hierarchical* organizational
  structure.
| The flat structure fosters power sharing among senior and junior
  members and avoids the many pitfalls of power-over dynamics. For
  example, in power-over structures, someone with explicit power can
  inadvertently, or on rare occasions intentionally, silence critical
  voices.
| This dynamic can quickly lead to an organization overlooking inherent
  problems that could lead to ineffectiveness or even catastrophic
  failure of the team.

| In contrast, our aim is to illuminate potential problems early and
  quickly find solutions.
| This strategy also efficiently taps into the diverse wealth of
  knowledge of the team.
| At the same time, the PI and Co-PI have financial and reporting
  responsibilities to their respective universities and funding
  agencies.
| The general procedure for the hybrid structure is as follows.
| The flat structure will make major decisions in direction and
  resources, and the PI and Co-PI will assume the responsibility for
  executing those decisions.
| The following gives details on this hybrid structure.

Team
----

The founding team consists of the following: original core developers
and Maintainers at Los Alamos National Lab, Jeremiah Murphy at Florida
State University, and Carl Fields at University of Arizona.

Since, an objective of Phoebus is to grow the developer and user base,
the Phoebus Project will have an explicit mechanism for adding new
members. There are three categories for ``Phoebus`` members:
maintainers, contributors, and users.

**User**: As open-source software, anyone may download, compile, and
execute ``Phoebus``. New users will encouraged to join communication
channels for connection with the larger ``Phoebus`` community.

**Contributor**: Users who wish to contribute to ``Phoebus`` may do so
following our Development Model for new users. These changes will be
integrated into the main branch of the code upon approval. Consistent
contributions also provides the opportunity for Contributors to be
eligible to join as a *Maintainer*, the final approval of which will
require a vote.

**Maintainer**: These are the core team who have “merge” permissions on
the repo and are working to keep the code sustainable long term.

To maintain their relevant active status, all members must 
make a food faith effort to maintain a supportive, productive environment.

Memorandum of Understanding
---------------------------

In addition to our Community Code of Conduct, we ask that maintainers 
especially keep the following suggestions in mind to help 
facilitate an efficient and welcoming collaboration:

-  Maintainers should uphold and exemplify the *Development Model*
   outlined as part of the ``phoebus`` Community described
   :doc:`here <contributing>`.
-  Within reason, maintainers will make a good-faith effort to attend team 
   meetings. In an effort to accommodate the dynamic schedules and 
   availability of many of the core team of *Maintainers*, 
   coordination efforts will be made to ensure that *at least* 
   1 *Maintainer* is present for all meetings.
-  Maintainers will make a good-faith effort to monitor the fraction of
   the meeting time that they speak. The meeting time is limited, and
   several people may have something interesting to say, report on their
   updates, or contribute constructive arguments. One should be
   self-aware and notice if one is dominating conversations, and attempt
   to make a conscious effort to include other voices and perspectives
   in the discussion.
-  Maintainers consider it their responsibility to voice their questions
   and/or concerns as early as possible. This will ensure that the
   organization addresses concerns rapidly and effectively.
-  Maintainers consider it their responsibility to listen and understand
   questions or concerns raised by other partners or through concerns
   communicated through email to individual *Maintainers*.

Approval by Vote:
-----------------

| Many of the decisions in the organization will be enacted after an
  approval by majority vote of active Maintainers. The process of listening
  and adjusting strategies to meet everyone’s needs is vital for
  power-sharing organizations.
| Importantly, spending a little time up front to listen and resolve
  concerns reduces the pain and time spent later in intense conflict
  resolution.

Communication and Connection:
-----------------------------

| To facilitate open and effective communication, the ``Phoebus`` will
  offer multiple levels of communication. 
  Developers will communicate via email, GitHub, and a ``Phoebus`` Slack
  channel.

| To respond to user inquiries, the Phoebus Project will host a mailing
  list via Google or similar.
| To maintain a standing record of user inquiries and responses, we will
  post the inquiries and responses on a public-facing site.
| All Maintainers will have the option to respond to the inquires; to
  ensure that someone is responsive to the user inquiries, the team will
  triage tickets/questions in developer meetings.

| Subject to availability, monthly Maintainer meetings will also
  be an important part of ensuring productivity and timeliness.
| Each meeting will last up to 60 minutes. We will assess and discuss
  the goals from the previous meeting.
| In particular, we will take note which goals were completed and which
  were not. If there are uncompleted goals, we will assess why they were
  not completed. Next, we will discuss the goals for the upcoming month,
  quarter, and year.
| We will decide which goals to prioritize.
| All of this will be recorded on an online document which will be
  available to all Maintainers.

| Each meeting of the core Maintainers will be managed by a meeting
  manager.
| The primary job of the meeting manager is to: 1) gather a list of
  agenda items for the next meeting, 2) ensure that the meeting runs on
  schedule, and 3) ensure equitable participation by all participants.
| Again, in keeping with power-sharing, the meeting manager position
  will rotate among the core Maintainers, even junior members. 

.. note::
  We maintain some flexibility in the cadence and structure of meetings, in
  particular, in periods of low activity, meetings may be skipped or
  held in a less formal manner. We recognize that the availability 
  of maintainers is contingent upon many factors.
